    <p>Greetings to All! I am a Liberian, who is interested in studying 
       web and computer programming. I am a first year student, 
       amd hope to learn this course so as to help others in my country
       and church. And as well to become a good school teacher. 
       I have four children. And pray to be a good father to my 
       wife and children. I hope we all can have a great study,
       which will help us to build Zion together. It has been a joy to be 
       attending BYU-I. I started with pathwayConnect before 
       the degree program now. But, I am facing challenges
       of electricity and internet. Those two things together
       with family cares are affecting my study.
       I hope to do well by the grace of Jesus Christ. 
    </p>
